    <h2>Hello Love, <br/> Firstly, Happy Valentine's Day! As you are aware of the fact that I really love writing letters to you, I am very fond of it. As we are in the generation where letters are very rare, I just had a small thought (It didn't strike me just like that!). The story behind the idea is that, one day while I was scrolling insta (as always XD), I came across this reel which was developed by a girl who wanted to ask her crush out on a date. I thought it was cute. So, i decided to make something for MY love, but I did not even have a code to it or any knowledge about it. All I knew was that i wanted to code one for you. So I began searching youtube for help. I swear, I coded this by myself after learning how to code on html!! I am very proud of myself right now. I am not saying this to tell you that I coded this by myself. I am saying this so that you understand how much I love you. I love you so much that I learnt a type of coding. All the ups and downs we ever had, they're just obstacles, and whatever happens in future, we have to fight it together. We must not let things or people get between us. We are one, We have been one and We Have To Be One. I love you, my love. I am hoping that we'd be together. Happy Valentine's Day! <br/>Love, <br/>Rita </h2>
